Stop Clock is a React Native app that alerts users when they have reached their destination on public transportation. Currently it only supports the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's (MBTA) T system. The MBTA's major bus routes and Commuter Rail services are coming soon. New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and the San Francisco Bay Area's Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) will be coming next.
